        I am working on a team with professor Jyh Liu in an undergraduate research experience. The topic of our research is for the area
        of blockchain systems and applications and how blockchaining technology can be used to protect and access digital identities. I am currently
         looking for post-graduation positions or internships for Fall 2021 and particularly interested in full-stack and web development.</td>

      <p class="text">About myself, I was originally born in Greenville, South Carolina, and I have moved to many places around the world to where I currently reside, Texas.
        I have been here most of my life but I have also lived in many other places like New York, Georgia, and Norway. I am a huge soccer fan so much so
      that I have been actively playing recreationally and competitively since 2006. Throughout my years, I have participated in youth soccer organizations such as BCYC, Centex Storm,
      Liverpool FC, TAMU Intramural, and B/CS Soccer League. I am a strong lefty that can hold his own in defense or midfield. In my free time other than playing soccer, I like to cook and game. My favorite meal to cook
      is a hearty breakfast and my favorite game is the Destiny series. In the community, I am a part of Aggie Coding Club where we work on team projects
      learn leardership, and also have fun in social events. I volunteer regularly at my local presbyterian church where I help with church service, 
      community events, and fundraisers. The jobs that I have worked for in the past are the USDA-ARS
      and Kona Ice where I learned valuable technical and soft skills. Knowledgable, dedicated, and with a willingness to learn, I am able to grasp new
      concepts quickly and perform well.</p>
